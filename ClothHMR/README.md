cd your_repo
conda create -n clothhmr python=3.10
conda activate clothhmr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage  

### Step 1: Download Pretrained Models 
Download the pretrained model from the following links and place it in the `data` folder:  
 [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bIReXbDqDlIKiu3xqTguNZ6iXaDzSseR/view?usp=drive_link)

### Step 2:   
 Create the `images` path and place your input images there.  
Use [sapiens](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sapiens) to obtain the human depth map and 133 keypoints.  
Save the depth maps in the `images_depth` folder and the pose keypoints in the `images_pose` folder, following the structure shown in the `examples` directory.

### Step 3: Run Demo 
```bash
# Run demo
cd apps
python  infer.py --in_dir ./examples/images --out_dir ./examples/output
#You can use TokenHMR, PyMAF, or SPIN to obtain the initial SMPL model.
```
